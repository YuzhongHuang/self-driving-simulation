## Introduction
This repository contains the affordance learning model for Olin's self driving car Gator Research. Affordance learning in real world can be costly and time consuming. Therefore, trying to simulate the possible effect for certain street image and providing as affordance for the model can be a desirable alternative. 

The image dataset for this project comes from [Google's Street View](http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/GMCP_Geolocalization/).
